fork of st with some tweaks:
- percentage based border buffer
- refined italic/bold/underline rendering
- click drag selection is slightly less sensitive to facilitate using inherently
  noisy input devices (eg. drawing tablets)
- middle click scroll
doesn't compile with gcc for some reason (cba to fix, feels like a gcc bug tbh),
compiles just fine with tcc though (with eg. `CC=tcc make`)

ORIGINAL README:
st - simple terminal
--------------------
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.


Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running st
----------
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info

See the man page for additional details.
